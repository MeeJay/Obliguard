/**
 * The one way to know a client's IP (agent public address on push and on the
 * WS command channel, and any future audit trail) — not the rate-limit key,
 * see below. Ported from Obliance (server/src/utils/clientIp.ts).
 *
 * `X-Forwarded-For` is a list the CLIENT can pre-fill: only the entries added
 * by proxies we trust are meaningful. Like Express's `trust proxy`, the list
 * is walked from the right (closest hop first) and the first address that is
 * NOT a trusted proxy is the client. Taking the first (left-most) value, as
 * this server used to, lets any client choose the address it is recorded with.
 *
 * Trusted proxies: env TRUSTED_PROXIES, comma-separated IPs, CIDRs or the
 * keywords loopback, linklocal, uniquelocal, self (the subnets of this
 * container's own interfaces — where the client container's nginx lives,
 * whatever address pool Docker uses). Default "loopback, self, 172.16.0.0/12":
 * the client container's nginx and a reverse proxy (Nginx Proxy Manager,
 * Traefik…) running in Docker on the same host.
 * If the socket peer is not trusted, X-Forwarded-For is ignored and every
 * client resolves to that peer (a relay, see resolveClient). A reverse proxy
 * elsewhere on the LAN must be added (e.g. TRUSTED_PROXIES="loopback, self,
 * 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.1.10").
 * Avoid "uniquelocal" when LAN clients reach the proxy directly: a LAN client
 * would then be treated as a proxy and could forge its address.
 *
 * TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS (default 2 = edge reverse proxy + the client container's
 * nginx) caps how many X-Forwarded-For entries are consumed. It closes the
 * case where the edge proxy only sees a Docker gateway (IPv6 through
 * docker-proxy, rootless Docker): the gateway is inside a trusted range, and
 * without the cap the walk would continue into the client-written part.
 * When the client container's port is reachable WITHOUT an edge proxy (port
 * published on the internet, IPv6 through docker-proxy, LAN clients in
 * 172.16/12), set TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS=1: with 2, such a client can choose the
 * address it is seen with.
 *
 * Rate limits do NOT use this function: they key on req.ip, which Express
 * ('trust proxy', 1 — app.ts) resolves to the address the client nginx saw,
 * something a client cannot forge.
